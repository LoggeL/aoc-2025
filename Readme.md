# Adevnt of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) programming challenges. Each day's challenge is implemented in a separate folder.

## Structure

- I'm using python for all solutions.
- Each folder is just named by the day number (e.g., `01`, `02`, ..., `25`).
- Inside each folder, there are 4 files:
  - `input`: The input data for the challenge.
  - `solve.py`: The Python script containing the solution to the challenge.
  - `test1`: Sample input for part 1 of the challenge.
  - `test2`: Sample input for part 2 of the challenge.

## Disclaimer

I'm not using AI for solving these challenges. All solutions are my own work. The code may be suboptimal or not follow best practices, as the primary goal is to have fun and learn through solving the puzzles.
